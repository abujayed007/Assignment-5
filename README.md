# Digital Wallet API

## Project Overview

The **Digital Wallet API** is a secure, modular, and role-based backend system (similar to **bKash** or **Nagad**) built with **Express.js** and **Mongoose**.

It provides core features such as **user and agent registration, wallet management, money transfers, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking**.

The system is designed with:

- Authentication & Role-based Authorization
- Wallet Management
- Transaction Handling
- Modular Code Architecture
- Well-defined API Endpoints

---

## Implemented Functional Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based login system
- Three roles: `admin`, `user`, `agent`
- Secure password hashing using **bcrypt**

### Wallet Management

- Automatic wallet creation for each `user` and `agent` during registration (with an initial balance of **à§³50**)

### User Functionalities

- Add money (top-up)
- Withdraw money
- Send money to another user
- View transaction history

### Agent Functionalities

- Add money to any user's wallet (cash-in)
- Withdraw money from any user's wallet (cash-out)

### Admin Functionalities

- View all users, agents, wallets, and transactions
- Block/unblock user wallets
- Approve/suspend agents

### Transaction Management

- All transactions are stored and trackable
- Role-based route protection is enforced
